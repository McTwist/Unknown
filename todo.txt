TODO:
Merge armies next to each other to get more armies for attack
Better prediction where the enemy will place his armies
Handle deadlocks better!

TESTING:
Be more aggressive on neutrals, but also use bigger armies to reduce loss
Prioritize neutrals with a few armies if possible to take over super regions
Colleberative attacks (Several regions attacks one region)
Spread attacks (Split up one region towards several regions if profitable)

FINISHED:
Fixed priority issues when placing armies on super regions
